Welcome to the Fraud Detection Project! This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning-based fraud detection system. The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate models that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions.
his project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using various machine learning algorithms. The main objective is to build a robust model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, thus helping to prevent financial losses.
